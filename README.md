This is a image processing project .
A person's gait is as unique as their voice timbre. Using this knowledge, gait recognition technology was created based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. ML-based systems can identify a person from an image even if their face is out of view, turned away from the camera, or concealed behind a mask.
